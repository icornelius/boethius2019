The entry ["Boethius"](http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/abstract/document/obo-9780195396584/obo-9780195396584-0222.xml?rskey=t6NAa2&result=30) in Oxford Bibliographies is a good starting point.

The following items, mostly recent, are omitted by the Oxford Bibliography but worth attention: 

* James J. O'Donnell's [website](https://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/) presents a Latin text of the *Consolatio*, O'Donnell's grammatical commentary on it, a brief bibliography, and other resources. 
* Oslo's [Bibliotheca Polyglotta](https://www2.hf.uio.no/polyglotta/index.php?page=volume&vid=216) presents a Latin text of the *Consolatio* and a selection of historically important translations.
* *The Legacy of Boethius in Medieval England: The Consolation and Its Afterlives*, edited by A. Joseph McMullen and Erica Weaver (ACMRS Publications, 2018).

I have contributed a chapter on Boethius's *Consolatio* in the *Oxford History of Classical Reception in English Literature, vol. 1: The Middle Ages* (Oxford University Press, 2016) 
and created an informal working bibliography on our course topic in [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), available for browsing [here](https://www.zotero.org/groups/boethius_dcp/items).

Whereas the "medieval Boethius" has been the subject of some half-dozen essay collections in the past twenty years, study of the "Renaissance Boethius" lags far behind. 
Begin with the brief essays by [Anthony Grafton](https://www.zotero.org/groups/268737/boethius_dcp/items/itemKey/J22DBKUF/) 
and [Lodi Nauta](https://www.zotero.org/groups/268737/boethius_dcp/items/itemKey/RBIIP93S/).
The best study of Jodocus Badius Ascensius's humanist commentary is [Reinhold Glei, '*Quae philosophia fuit, facta philologia est*'](https://www.zotero.org/groups/268737/boethius_dcp/items/itemKey/7WF348WS/).
