This outline of the *Consolatio* draws from J. J. O'Donnell's commentary (1990) and John Marenbon's *Boethius* (2003), with some debatable alterations.

  B. = Boethius the prisoner  
  P. = Philosophia

# Setting the scene; Philosophia's diagnosis (bk. 1)

1.m1: B.'s complaint. (Elegiac couplets.)

1.p1: P. appears, a mysterious figure. She drives the poetic muses away.  
1.m2: P. contrasts B's former energy and vision with his present state.

1.p2: B. is unresponsive; P. makes a preliminary diagnosis, speaking of B. in the third person.  
1.m3: B. announces that his vision has returned (or is P. speaking for B.?).

1.p3: B. recognizes P.; she explains why she has come.  
1.m4: P.: The truly wise man is serene, above all hopes and fears.

1.p4: B.'s *apologia*.  
1.m5: B. continues his complaint; the Creator governs everything but human affairs.
(5.m3 is also spoken by B.)

1.p5: P. reacts calmly to B.'s complaint; his illness is worse than she thought.  
1.m6: Success attends those who adapt their actions to the pattern of nature. 
Hence, presumably, P.'s sequence of medicines.

1.p6: P. questions B. to determine the nature of his ailment and plan the course of her argument.

1.m7: Coda to book one. Clouds part to restore sunlight. Injunction to banish passions.

# Defining happiness I: The Stoic-Epicurean treatment (bk. 2)
## Fortuna (2.p1--m2)
2.p1: It is foolish to complain of adverse fortune. 
B. ought to have known that fortune is arbitrary and unjust. 
Description continues in 2.m1.

2.p2: P. impersonates Fortuna stating her case. 
This continues in 2.m2, where mankind is reproached for insatiable greed.

## Epicurean treatment (2.p3--m4)
In 2p.3 P. recalls the happiness B. previously enjoyed; in 2.p4. she reminds B. of his present good fortune and causes for happiness.  
2.m3 affirms that vacillation between peace and turmoil is ordinary and expected.  
2.m4 affirms that the wise man lives quietly in humble circumstances.

## First analysis of false goods (2.p5--m7)

2.p5: Criticism of wealth (*divitiae*): it cannot truly be owned and is of no value.  
2.m5: The Golden Age enjoyed happiness without riches.

2.p6: Criticism of worldly offices (*dignitates*) and power (*potentia*).  
2.m6: Nero: a famous example of wickedness unimproved by power. 

2.p7: Criticism of fame (*gloria*, *fama*). The view from above.  
2.m7: Arguments against *gloria* restated.

## Coda

2.p8: Fortune has its uses: adverse fortune as spiritual exercise.

2.m8: The world is bound by love. (An anticipation of 3.m9.)

# Defining happiness II: Platonic treatment (bk. 3)
## A complex conception of happiness (3.p1--m8)
### Prologue (3.p1--m2)
3.p1: Encouraged by progress in B.'s cure, P. promises to lead B. towards an identification of true happiness.  
3.m1: In nature, beautiful things are easier to appreciate against a background of adversity. (So also in arguments.)

3.p2: Abstract definition of true happiness. This is preparation for a fresh consideration of the goods of fortune.  
3.m2: Nature is inexorable: illustrated by lions, songbirds, trees, the sun.

### Second analysis of false goods (3p3--p8)
3.p3: Criticism of **wealth** (again): it cannot bring *sufficientia*.  
3.m3: The rich are plagued by cares.

3.p4: Criticism of **public** offices: they do not bring *reverentia*.  
3.m4: Worldly offices do not convey true honor: Nero (cf. 2.m6).

3.p5: Criticism of **power**: it is not the property of kings.  
3.m5: True power lies within the person.

3.p6: Criticism of **glory**: it does not bring *claritudo*. True nobility is acquired through virtuous deeds.  
3.m6: All people are equally noble by birth.

3.p7: Criticism of **physical pleasure and family**: it does not bring *laetitia*.  
3.m7: Pleasure is briefly sweet but leaves a bitter taste.

3.p8, m8: Summary. 
To find true goodness, one needs accurate knowledge.

## A Simplex conception of happiness (3.p9--p12)
### Prologue
3.p9: True happiness is indivisible. 
Turn from negative to positive inquiry.

3.m9: A prayer to the creator.
Verse synopsis of the cosmology of Plato's *Timaeus*.
This is **the centerpiece of the entire work**. 

### The unity of the Good (3.p10--p12)
3.p10: Argument that true happiness = true goodness = God. Every good man is God.  
3.m10: True happiness bestows a light brighter than the sun.

3.p11: The Good and the One are the same.  
3.m11: Truth must be discovered in exercise of memory, or *anamnēsis*.
 
3.p12: God regulates the world as its final cause. (Cf. questions posed in 1.p6.)

### Coda
3.m12: How Orpheus recovered and lost Eurydice. Do not look down.

# The problem of evil (bk. 4)
## Statement of the problem; Philosophia's prologue
4.p1: B. laments the presence of unpunished evil in the realm of a good and omnipotent God. 
P. denies the charge and sets to demonstrate divine justice.  

4.m1: The mind has powers to ascend to its true homeland. 
The view from above (cf. 2.p7 and 3.m12); Plato's *Phaedrus* (cf. 3.m9, 3.m11). 

## Impotence and Self-Punishment of Wickedness (4.p2--m4)
4.p2: P. holds that the virtuous are powerful, the wicked impotent.  
4.m2: Those who appear powerful in this world are in truth impotent.

4.p3: Good men are like gods, while bad men are merely beasts.  
4.m3: Odysseus's men turned into wild beasts by Circe.

4.p4: The misery of the wicked.  
4.m4: Life is short: take pity on the wicked.

## Providence and human happiness (4.p5--p7)
4.p5: B. continues to object that the apparently unjust distribution of fortune's gifts is legitimate cause for dismay at the workings of providence. (B. speaks for almost the entirety of this section.)  

4.m5: P. responds. To understand an event, it is necessary to understand its causes.
(This combination of line-types is unique to DCP.)  
4.p6: Response, continued. The relation between providence and fate. The concentric circles. (This is the longest single *prosa* in DCP.)

4.m6: The world is ruled by design. (1.m5 shares the same meter, topic, line count, and outline.)  
4.p7: Everything that happens, including 'bad fortune', is for the good.

## Coda
4m7 Heroic endurance leads to success (?). 
Agamemnon's sacrifice of Iphigenia; the labors of Hercules.
Like 3.m2, this meter has been seen as standing in problematic relation to Philosophia's argument. 

# Providence and prescience: concepts and their implications (bk 5)
## Prologue: Divine providence in the realm of nature
5.p1: B. insists that P. explain the nature of chance (*casus*); P. complies, protesting that the question is a dangerous diversion.
A definition is drawn from Aristotle and illustrated with the case of gold found in a field.  
5.m1: Apparent chance is subject to the laws of causation. 
Illustrated by Tigris and Euphrates. 
(Elegiac couplets, as also 1m1.)

## Divine prescience and human freedom
5.p2: Acts of will are uniquely free (that is, exempt from causal determination by divine providence), but there are grades of freedom.  
5.m2: The creator sees and hears all things everywhere: He is the true sun.

5.p3: B. sketches the problem of prescience, emphasizing challenges to (1) the legitimacy of divine retributive justice and (2) prayer as nexus between humans and divinity.
This entire prose is spoken by B. (cf. 4.p5.) 
B. then puts his perplexity into verse (= 5.m3; cf. 1m5, also spoken by B.): 
contradiction and the desire to resolve it; Meno's paradox, resolved by the theory of *anamnēsis* (cf. 3m11).

5.p4: P. begins her answer. 
Analysis of kinds of cognition: *sensus*, *imaginatio*, *ratio*, and *intellegentia*.
General epistemological principle: knowledge is a function of the power of the knower.  
5.m4: P. disputes the Stoic conception of the mind as *tabula rasa*.

5.p5: The four kinds of cognition are distributed to four grades of being. 
The limitation of *ratio* relative to divine *intelligentia* is illustrated by analogy to dissension between *ratio* and the lower forms of knowledge.
Through spiritual ascent, *ratio* may arrive at a point where it perceives its own limitations. 

5.m5: A lesson from comparative anatomy: man alone is upright in posture; he should send his thoughts upwards. 
(Cf. the similarly facile conclusion to 4.p3?)

5.p6: Eternity distinguished from perpetuity. 
Divine knowledge sees from the vantage point of eternity and thus knows all that has happened and will happen without impeding freedom of human voluntary action.
