This is a course site for "Boethius's *Consolation of Philosophy* and its Afterlife", [a 10-week graduate seminar](https://www.newberry.org/01112019-boethius-s-consolation-philosophy-and-its-afterlife) run at the Newberry Library in winter quarter of 2019.

# rationale
Written early in the sixth century by the Roman philosopher and statesman Boethius, the *Consolation of Philosophy* was among the most influential works of literature in medieval Europe, valued as an authoritative synthesis of ancient philosophy, a compendium of poetry and mythological lore, a first-person narrative of embattled virtue, and a model of dialectical method applied to intractable problems in ethics, metaphysics, and theology.

In this seminar we examine the *Consolation* and its medieval and early modern reception, with a focus on the problems -- and opportunities -- that this text presented to successive generations of readers. 
What did readers seek from the *Consolation*, and what gave them trouble in it? 
How did this text enable new ways of thinking and writing, and how did these innovations change the meaning of the *Consolation* itself? 
As a mixed-genre work read widely over a long period, the *Consolation* and its tradition provide unique insight into the dynamic literary cultures of premodern Europe.

# schedule of classes and readings
We meet in the ITW seminar room on the ground floor of the library except as indicated in the schedule below.
I will be out of town on March 8: we must decide whether and how to reschedule that meeting.
If we decide to reschedule, we may give a meeting each to Thomas More and Justus Lipsius (currently combined on March 1). 

I will offer optional supplementary sessions -- probably an hour per week, in person or via Skype -- for students who have some knowledge of Latin and want to read parts of the *Consolation* in the original language.
