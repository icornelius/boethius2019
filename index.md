This page is a course site for "Boethius's *Consolation of Philosophy* and its Afterlife", run at the Newberry Library in winter quarter of 2019.

Written early in the sixth century by the Roman philosopher and statesman Boethius, the *Consolation of Philosophy* was among the most influential works of literature in medieval Europe, valued as an authoritative synthesis of ancient philosophy, a compendium of poetry and mythological lore, a first-person narrative of embattled virtue, and a model of dialectical method applied to intractable problems in ethics, metaphysics, and theology.

In this seminar, we examine the *Consolation* and its medieval and early modern reception, with a focus on the problems -- and opportunities -- that this text presented to successive generations of readers. 
What did readers seek from the *Consolation*, and what gave them trouble in it? 
How did this text enable new ways of thinking and writing, and how did these innovations change the meaning of the *Consolation* itself? 
As a mixed-genre work read widely over a long period, the *Consolation* and its tradition provide unique insight into the dynamic literary cultures of premodern Europe.
